Data for stochastic shortest-path

Each dataset contains two files.

The first file defines the instance by edges: 
node1 node2 alpha beta mean.
(alpha and beta are the parameters of the Weibull distribution defining the weights)

The second file contains input-solution samples where each line shows one sample:
